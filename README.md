# Mini_Uber_Java_Project
This project is a simplified version of the Uber ride-hailing application built using Java. It focuses on implementing the core functionalities of booking a ride between a customer and a driver. The aim is to practice Java concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, and optionally basic databases/JSON files for persistence.
